This is the lecture notes scribed by me. If you find any mistakes in the notes please email me at \url{lzhang34@terpmail.umd.edu}. 

These notes are taken from Paul Kline's CMSC250 course and are an abridged version of notes I take during lectures. I am not a particularly heavy notetaker, so do note a strong possibility of some missing content in here if I deemed it not needed to be noted. For that reason, I would recommend you only use this as supplemental notes in addition to your own. An excellent source are the in-depth notes from Justin, which I believe are the teaching notes the course is based upon \href{https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/CMSC250/}{https://www.math.umd.edu/~immortal/CMSC250/}
